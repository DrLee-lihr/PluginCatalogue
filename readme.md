# MCDReforged Plugin Catalogue

A repository for listing [MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged) plugins

[Click me](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue/blob/catalogue/readme.md) to see the plugin catalogue index

Visit [here](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue/tree/meta) to see the catalogue meta 

Only includes plugins compatible with MCDReforged >=2.x

For those plugins designed for previous version of MCDR, you can have a look at the [legacy](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue/tree/legacy) branch. If the plugin works in MCDR 1.x then it will probably work in MCDR >=2.x

Feel free to submit your PR if you want to add your plugin. Check the [document](https://mcdreforged.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_dev/plugin_catalogue.html) for more information
